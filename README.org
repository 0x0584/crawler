* IN-PROGRESS Tasks

- State "IN-PROGRESS" from "TODO"       [2020-02-10 Mon 17:48]

- [ ] Write an application to crawl articles on a news website such as [theguardian.com](http://theguardian.com) or [bbc.com](http://bbc.com/) using a crawler framework such as [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org). You can use a crawl framework of your choice and build the application in Python.

- [ ] The application should cleanse the articles to obtain only information relevant to the news story, e.g. article text, author, headline, article url, etc. Use a framework such as Readability to cleanse the page of superfluous content such as advertising and HTML.

- [ ] Store the data in a hosted Mongo database, e.g. [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), for subsequent search and retrieval. Ensure the URL of the article is included to enable comparison to the original.

- [ ] Write an API that provides access to the content in the mongo database. The user should be able to search for articles by keyword
